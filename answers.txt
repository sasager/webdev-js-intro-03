1) + is both a concatenation operator and an arithemetic operator. If a string is added to a number, the number is converted to a string due to type coercion so that they can be added together.

2) == performs type coercion, so if a user inputs a string in a field where the input is expected to be a number, the function could incorrectly validate something like a discount code typed as a string. === does not perform type coercion and should be used in these scenarios instead.

3) Most of the operators not listed on the concept page (like most of the ones on the MDN page) are confusing to me because I haven't had enough experience to truly understand how and why they're used. The arithmetic and logic operators seem pretty self explanatory for the most part.

4) You could use the modulus operator to create a circular array, rotating through something like a list of people on a loop in order to schedule shifts fairly.
